Strategies include accurate cost estimation, regular budget tracking, risk management, and prioritizing essential features.

## 3. Compare and contrast Agile and Waterfall methodologies. What are the main advantages and disadvantages of each?

        Agile:

Pros: Flexible, iterative, user feedback-driven, adaptive to changes.
Cons: Requires active collaboration, can be harder to estimate time/cost.

        Waterfall:

Pros: Structured, clear requirements, easy to manage documentation.
Cons: Inflexible, costly to make changes, slow to respond to feedback.
## 4. In what types of projects might Agile be more beneficial than Waterfall, and vice versa? Can you provide examples of each?

Agile: Best for dynamic projects like mobile apps or SaaS platforms where user feedback is frequent.

Waterfall: Ideal for structured projects like banking software or infrastructure systems where strict requirements exist.

## 5. What are some methods for ensuring quality assurance throughout a software project? Why is it important to maintain high standards?

Methods: Automated testing, code reviews, usability testing.
Importance: Prevents bugs, enhances user experience, and ensures software reliability.

## 6. How does defining the project scope contribute to successful project planning? What is a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), and why is it useful?
